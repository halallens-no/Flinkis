       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
